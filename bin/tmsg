#!/bin/bash

# From Jon Purdy:
# If youâ€™re using tmux and iTerm, you can use this script to send
# desktop notifications from a script on your devserver:
#
# It will not work from within mosh, unfortunately (not sure why); also,
# if you want to adapt this to use a fancy control sequence for a different
# terminal, you just need to place it between \033Ptmux; and \033\\ and
# double up any \033 / \x1b s to escape them
#
#
# Usage:
#
#  $ ./configure && make && make install ; tmsg "Job is done!"
#

message="$@"
printf '\033Ptmux;\033\033]9;%s\007\033\\' "$message"

# or '\x1bPtmux;\x1b\x1b]9;%s\x07\x1b\\' if you prefer
